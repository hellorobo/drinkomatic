# What does it do?
The code controls a drink pouring machine built from easy accessible parts such as aquarium pumps and a couple of relays.
The machine uses **Raspberry Pi** as it's brain.

This code was used to control the drink pouring machine at the Python-Łódź Meetup held in Łódź (Poland). During the presentation the machine was controlled with an Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa powered) device.

# Whats inside these files?
`drinkomatic.py` - The main module. It controls electronic parts and provides friendly drink-pouring API.
`pour_test.py` - A simple use case of a `drikomatic.py` module.
